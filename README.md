Inspector is a security tool with the purpose of identifying users who have both successfully and unsuccessfully switched to root or another user on Linux based Distributions. It does this by scanning through `/var/log/auth.log` for specific patterns that indicate specific actions/executed commands.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Install the required dependencies using either of the following commands:

- `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt` (installs globally)
- `pipenv install -r requirements.txt` (installs locally via pipenv)

### Installing

All you need to do is download the repository. There are no binaries or anything to install.

`git clone https://github.com/StrangeRanger/inspector/`

## Usage

Because Inspector needs to access `/var/log/auth.log`, you'll be required to execute Inspector with root priviledge:

`sudo python3 inspector.py`

## Supported Distributions

The following is a list of all the Linux Distributions that Inspector officially supports and works on:

| Distributions | Distro Versions         |
| ------------- | ----------------------- |
| Ubuntu        | 20.04<br>16.04<br>18.04 |
