## Identifying Logs

In order for Inspector to work, it must be able to identify specific logs that are placed in the auth.log whenever a specific event occurs. I've created an easy to read document/page detailing what is logged for almost, if not all, commands that can be used to switch to either the root or another user's account. For Debian 10, refer to [Doc 1](doc-1.md), and for Ubuntu 16.04, Ubuntu 18.04, and Debian 9, refer to [Doc 2](doc-2).
