[![Project Status: WIP â€“ Initial development is in progress, but there has not yet been a stable, usable release suitable for the public.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/wip.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#wip)

This repo will be the start of the next major revision of the project previously called [Identify Root User Logins](https://github.com/StrangeRanger/identify-root-user-logins). The old repo was an obsolute mess, and was terribly managed. I am creating this new repo to rename the project and to start fresh.
