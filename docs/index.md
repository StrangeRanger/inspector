# Introduction

The script was created for the purpose of identifying users, on a Linux based system, who have successfully and unsuccessfully logged into/switch to the root user account as well as those who have successfully and unsuccessfully switched to a different user on the system. It does this by looking for a hardcoded pattern/string/set of lines that are written to /var/log/auth.log. These patterns can be looked at in identifying-patterns.odt.
