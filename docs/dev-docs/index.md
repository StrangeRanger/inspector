## Identifying Logs

For Inspector to work, it must be able to identify specific logs placed in `auth.log` whenever a particular event occurs. I've created an easy to read document/page detailing what is logged for almost if not all, commands that can be used to switch to either root or another user's account.

Refer to [Doc 1](doc-1.md) for:

* Debian 10

Refer to [Doc 2](doc-2.md) for:

* Ubuntu 16.04 and 18.04
* Debian 9
